# Software-Engineering-Project-July-2024

My colleagues and I developed this project as part of the Software Engineering exam during our third year in the Bachelorâ€™s degree program in Computer Engineering at the University of Naples Federico II. The project was approved with top marks by the professor. This work involves the development of an online booking system for a chain of Bed & Breakfasts located in various tourist destinations. 

The system, through an appropriate graphical interface (GUI), allows registered users to view the list of all B&Bs in the system and filter them based on their location, and then possibly book one for a specific period if it is available on the selected dates. 
The system also allow users to view all B&Bs available during the selected dates and then make a reservation. 
Once a booked stay is completed, a customer, through an appropriate graphical interface (GUI), can rate the B&B they stayed in from 1 to 5. 
A customer may also choose to cancel a reservation without any charges, provided the cancellation occurs at least 48 hours before the stay, otherwise, the cost of the booked stay will be charged.
In addition to the management of services for customers, an administration section has been provided, intended for administrator users of the application. System administrators can add, modify, or remove B&Bs or additional services. Furthermore, administrators have access to reports on bookings and the properties.

The application is clearly a functional prototype, intended for educational purposes only. In fact, to test its correct functioning, we used an offline database (MySQL), which we populated with fictitious data. We developed the application in Java (JavaSE-17) and used several supporting libraries, such as: mysql-connector-java-8.0.29.jar, junit-4.13.2.jar, hamcrest-core-1.3.jar.
